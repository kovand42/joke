This is a prototype website under construction, that allows developers to collaborate on projects.
After registration users can add their skills, and launch new projects or send requests to work 
on projects (for which they have the necessary skills).
On the project pages project members can add further skills to the project if needed,
project admins can invite developers - from users' list with needed skills or all users' list - to work together on the project.
By default you can find two users, 'joe' and 'kovand42'. Both passwords are 'theboss'.
Explore and have fun
